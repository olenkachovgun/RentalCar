# React + Vite: RentalCarüöò Frontend

## General Information
This project is the frontend part of the "RentalCar" web application, designed for car rentals. It's built to interact with the backend API, available at: [https://car-rental-api.goit.global/api-docs/](https://car-rental-api.goit.global/api-docs/).
The main goal of this project is to provide users with a convenient interface for viewing available cars, filtering them, adding them to favorites, and making reservations.
